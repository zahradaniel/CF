1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Music

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Three thumbs down for my AVP

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Three point five just to hear me sleep

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I do like Joelle and me

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
She'll never ever get a ring for me

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
She on my line like we got a thunk on her

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't know that it can't be deep

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ten hall bounds a tap of the shelf on her

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Damn, I'm key

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't think that she want me for me

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Damn, am I tweaking?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
All my little hide and yell

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Quiet it down, I ain't lie to you

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You get proud of it, times of it's profit if all

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Tide and yell, I ain't flying with your love

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Die for us, think to the quiet all

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, I ain't going for it, no

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't know no, I just got all my days on my lungs some

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I ain't going to bed to this globe

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's all all in my chest, it is closed

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Get cold as December when I'm closed

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a feet 12 inch, I don't go slow

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Damn, just hold on

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I better go out of here for me

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Damn, I better run with her and I don't care

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Damn, are you telling my side off?

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
God damn, you know I got, you know I got all my days on me

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Three thumbs down for my every feet

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Three point five just to help me sleep

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I do like Joelle and me

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She'll never ever get a ring for me

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
She on my line like we got a thunk on her

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know that it can't be deep

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ten hall bounds a tap of the shelf on her

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Cause but it can't be cheap

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Damn, I don't keep, I don't think that she want me for me

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Damn, am I sweet?

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Or am I low high to y'all?

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Quiet it down, I ain't lying to y'all

You get proud of it, times of it's profit if all

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
High to y'all lying, flying with y'all

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Down for a stick to the quiet all

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't got much left, I'm talking all about myself

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I know what's right was wrong, I got sound got much less

Run me out ill put the windows down

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Run around telling that I'm my guy

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Way in the head that you get different

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think I could get this hot

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't think I'm gonna risk this one

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The yolks ain't worth 50 bucks

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You really miss me huh?

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
